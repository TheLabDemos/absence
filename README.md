Issues
------
The code in this repository is currently incomplete. It's only the demo-specific
parts, which use my circa 2002-2003 3D engine, and other reusable pieces of code
which I kept out of tree back then. I think I have all the pieces, and I intend
to gather them all up into this repo soon.

This demo and the 3D engine it uses (which is missing at the moment), was
originally written for windows and it's not portable.  When I gather all the
bits in this repo, I'd like to port it to OpenGL and GNU/Linux, but this will
probably take some time.

Also this demo used fmod for music playback, which I intend to replace with
mikmod, to avoid proprietary dependencies.

Unfortunately this repository doesn't contain the original commit history,
because I wasn't using any kind of source control when I wrote this demo.
