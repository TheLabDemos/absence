Issues
------
The 3D engine code I dug up is from a slightly later date than the demo, and
contains some changes which introduce bugs and graphical glitches to the demo,
when compared to the pre-compiled version from back then.

This demo and the 3D engine it uses, were originally written for windows using
the Direct3D 8 API, which make them not portable. I'd like to port it to OpenGL
and GNU/Linux, but this will probably take some time.

Also this demo used fmod for music playback, which I intend to replace with
mikmod, to avoid proprietary dependencies.

Unfortunately this repository doesn't contain the original commit history,
because I wasn't using any kind of source control when I wrote this demo.
